      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How do I create a marker?</h3>
      <p>Tap the pin button at the bottom of the map screen while at your location. The marker will be placed at your current GPS coordinates. Premium users can also long-press the button to drop a pin anywhere on the map.</p>

      <h3>How do I record panning results?</h3>
      <p>Tap on any marker to open its details. Scroll to the "Panning Results" section and tap "Add Test" to record the number of colors and pan size. This data is used for analytics and the color-coded map view.</p>

      <h3>How do I share markers with friends?</h3>
      <p>First, add friends using the Friends screen (accessible from the menu). Once connected, open any marker and tap the share icon to share it with specific friends or make it public.</p>

      <h3>What are the colored overlays on the map?</h3>
      <p>The map can display BLM mining claims (active and closed) and historical mine locations. Enable these layers by tapping the layers button on the map screen. Note: Claim data is for reference only - always verify through official BLM sources.</p>

      <h3>How does offline mode work?</h3>
      <p>Your markers and data are automatically cached on your device. You can create and edit markers without internet connection. Changes will sync to the cloud when you're back online. Premium users can also download map tiles for offline viewing.</p>

      <h3>How do I export my data?</h3>
      <p>Go to the Analytics screen and tap the export button to download your markers and mining results as CSV files.</p>
